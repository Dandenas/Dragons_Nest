To fix the noob run.bat error (if you can't run server and it gives you errors)

Use this link to download JDK 6. Then, compile the server, and run it after you install JDK 6.

Change owner commands: 
~ CommandPacketHandler
~ AdminCommands
Replace "aviboss" (in quotations) with your owner name (in quotations)
Replace "goudont" (in quotations) with your owner name (in quotations)

To make yourself owner:
~ ActionSender.java
Replace: "Goudont" with "yourownername"
Replace: "Aviboss" with "yourownername"

If it demotes you automatically upon login, change the names in ActionSender.java,
and use the ;;givemod, ;;giveadmin command to prevent it for other staff on your server.

Change Server name in:
~ Config.java

Change owner names in:
~Config.java

Change welcome screen stuff in:
~Config.java

Change welcome message in:
~Config.java

Anything to do with server name or something, use config.java
